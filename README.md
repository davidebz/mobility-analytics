# geobank-analytics

## Local development

Run the application with `SERVER_PORT=8999 mvn tomcat7:run`

## Docker environment

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose exec java /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose exec java /bin/bash -c "mvn clean install"

# or

docker-compose exec java /bin/bash -c "mvn clean test"
```
### Map style
Default map style uses openstreetmap. To use the [Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com) map style, you can add your Thunderforest API key to the configuration file in src/main/webapp/config.js
